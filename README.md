# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms in C. These structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, and heaps. The accompanying algorithms cover various sorting techniques such as bubble, insertion, selection, merge, and quick sort.

## Overview
